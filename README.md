- Day 11, July 8th, Monday:  It took 1 hour to train a basic deep learning chatbot model on my laptop. Then I moved the model to Colaboratory (Colab, Google free Cloud service), adjusted settings, selected GPU as Hardware accelerator, mounted my Google Drive, downloaded the dataset (corpus) directly to Google Drive via Google Colab. I took a few minutes to run the whole model with Colab. Nothing gets me moving like a completed task.


- Day 12, July 9th, Tuesday: participated at study group virtual meeting, worked on chatbot, started reading book "PyTorch A Problem-Solution Approach" by Pradeepta Mishra.


- Day 13, July 10th, Wednesday: worked on Dog Identification project, encourage @Ricardo Felipe Redin @Eric Ndirangu @Ahmad Waly @Y. Leonce Eyog  @PJha to share the progress on learning and @Marcos Junior @Fitsum Ayalew to take up the challenge.


- Day 14, July 11, Thursday: continued working on Dog Breed Identification project. I encourage @hammedb @Aakanksha Dhurandhar @Idan Benaun to share the learning progress.


- Day 15, July 12, Friday: continued working on Dog Breed Identification. I encourage @Pablo Carmona - Zuluaga @hammedb @Idan Benaun @Idan Benaun @uday.kiran @Yanbin Zhang @Temitope Oladokun @Rabin Banjade @Elif Yalı @R Aishwarya @Elif Yalı @Waad Gamal Shehabeldin @qayyumb to share the learning progress. Time, when it left to itself, cannot be trusted to move at any pace.


- Day 16, July 13, Saturday: continued working on Dog Breed Identification project. I encourage @Lakshay Wadhwa @K3NNi @J.D.V.P.REDDY @Hachiman @Gabor Soter @Fabio @Daibin Raju @Waad Gamal Shehabeldin @R Aishwarya @medhagupta098 @falconArrow @hammedb @Vaibhav @Claudia Hill @Xiaolei Zhang @Yanbin Zhang.

- Day 17, July 14, Sunday: continued working on Dog Breed Identification project

- Day 18, July 15, Monday: registered for AWS Online Conference on the 18th July to learn how to deploy a basic deep learning model on cloud; encoraged @ Marcos Junior to take up challenge; continued working on Dog Breed Identification project on Kaggle (got stuck with Value Error) https://www.kaggle.com/reallygooday/dog-breed-identification-exploration

- Day 19, July 16, Tuesday: read "PyTorch Recipes" by Pradeepta Mishra.

- Day 20, July 17, Wednesday: read book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Vishnu Subramanian.

- Day 21, July 18, Thursday: attended/ watched the AWS Innovate Conference online about PyTorch inference with Amazon SageMaker.
