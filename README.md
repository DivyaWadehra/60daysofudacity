## ***I'm Super Excited, Let's Get Started***

- **Day :one:  June 28th, Friday**: 
   - [x] :smiley: Prioritising & Planning 

        Secure and Private AI Challenge content summary:
        - Differential Privacy
        - Evaluating the Privacy of a Function

   - [x] :smiley: Let's see how I can do that. Link to GitHub repo: 
   
            https://github.com/reallygooday/60daysofudacity/blob/master/Differential_Privacy.ipynb
          
____

- **Day :two: June 29th, Saturday**: Gaining intuitive understanding about the basics of Neural Networks:
   - [x] :smiley:   First Takeaway --> the term 'Logistic Regression' represents a small Neural Network and learning algorithm for Binary Classification Problem;
   - [x] :smiley:   Second Takeaway --> the loss function of Logistic Regression computes the error for a single training example,
   the cost function of Logistic Regression is the average of the loss function of the entire training set);
   - [x] :smiley:   Third Takeaway --> the term 'Gradient Descent algorithm' represents the slope of the function;
   - [x] :smiley:   Forth Takeaway --> computations of Neural Networks organised in terms of a forward pass (or a forward propagation step),
   in which we compute output of Neural Networks, followed by a backward pass (or a back propagation step), which we use to compute gradients or derivatives.
____

- **Day :three: June 30th, Sunday**: 
   - [x] :smiley:   doing the programming exercises;
   - [x] :smiley:   learning about vectorization, re-writting explicit 'for' loops;
   - [x] :smiley:   non-vectorize, looped code takes much longer than vectorize code;
   - [x] :smiley:   read the article **'Why you should forget ‘for-loop’ for data science code and embrace vectorization'**
   - [x] :smiley:   link to the article:
   
                    https://towardsdatascience.com/why-you-should-forget-for-loop-for-data-science-code-and-embrace-vectorization-696632622d5f

 ____

- **Day :four: July 1th, Monday**: 
   - [x] :smiley:   read the article **'Broadcasting with PyTorch'**;
   - [x] :smiley:   I allude briefly to the main points, Rules of Broadcasting -->
        - Rule 0: Each tensor has at least one dimension(trivial)
        - Rule 1: If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded with ones on its leading (left) side.
        - Rule 2: If the shape of the two arrays does not match in any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape.
        - Rule 3: If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.   

    - [x] :smiley:  link to the article:

- **Day :three::nine: August 5, Monday**: 
  - [x] read the paper about MSG-Net; link to the paper:
  
              https://github.com/reallygooday/60daysofudacity/blob/master/academic%20paper/Zhang_Multi-style_Generative_Network_for_Real-time_Transfer_ECCVW_2018_paper.pdf  
  
  - [x] experimented with PyTorch MSG-Net:
  
           The Multi-style Generative Network is the first to achieve real-time brush size control for multi-style  transfer.
            The picture below shows the Style Transfer results. Personal photos used as content.
